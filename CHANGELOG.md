### Version 2.3.0 (Oct 17, 2018)

- [JENKINS-52964](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-52964) - add `SCMFileSystem.Builder#supports(SCMSourceDescriptor)` and `#supports(SCMDescriptor)` methods.

### Version 2.2.8 (Sept 28, 2018)

- Add traits-related methods to `SCMNavigator` and `SCMSource` base classes.

### Version 2.2.7 (Apr 20, 2018)

### Version 2.2.6 (Dec 13, 2017)

- Enhanced the mock implementation test harness to allow testing SCMSource.afterSave() and SCMNavigator.afterSave() (no changes to user code)

### Version 2.2.5 (Nov 3, 2017)

- Add a utility API to allow implementation plugins to use a standard mechanism for normalizing SCM URIs in order to assist comparisons (no user visible changes)

### Version 2.2.4 (Nov 2, 2017)

- Clarify the help text for the built in filters.
  The built in filters treat the SCMHead name as a name, no special processing.
   A lot of people were wondering why when they set a filter like `master feature/*` why none of the PRs were building... the reason being that `PR-123` does not match the filter.
   When using the filters built in to SCM-API you probably want something like `master feature/* PR-*` to get PRs to build.
   An alternative filter implementation that probably does what you actually want is [SCM Filter Branch PR Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/scm-filter-branch-pr) as that will filter non-change requests like the built in filters but has a special case for PRs where instead it filters those based on the PR target head rather than the name of the PR (which will always be PR-... unless the SCMSource uses a different prefix for its change request concept

### Version 2.0.1 (Jan 16, 2016)

This release caused [JENKINS-41121](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-41121).

- Please read [this Blog Post](https://jenkins.io/blog/2017/01/17/scm-api-2/) before upgrading

### Version 2.0.1-beta-1 (Dec 16, 2016)

- Released to experimental update center to allow testing the downstream changes in github-branch-source and bitbucket-branch-source (both of which need upgrading to at least 2.0.0-beta-1 if you have them installed on your master)

### Version 2.0 (Dec 7, 2016)

- [JENKINS-38987](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-38987)
    Added pronouns to assist consuming plugins to name concepts like:
    SCMHead; SCMSource; and SCMNavigator with SCM specific idiomatic
    names, e.g. GitHub can respectively provide pronouns
    "Branch"/"Tag"/"Pull request"; "Repository"; "Server", whereas
    something like Accurev could provide pronouns "Stream"/"Snapshot";
    "Depot"; "Repository". The pronouns are more relevant for SCMHead as
    typically each SCM implementation is likely to have more than one
    type of head: mainlines, branches, tags, change requests, etc
- [JENKINS-39355](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-38355) Various
    API improvements that make it easier to implement/consume SCM API
    including the addition of an event system to allow SCM
    implementations to consolidate push event handling from their
    backing SCM server.
- [JENKINS-40138](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-40138) SCMHead.getActions()
    should never have been introduced into the SCM API. JENKINS-33309
    was a mistake. The API is now marked as DoNotUse and is
    non-functional. Replacement API for the correct way to access the
    corresponding information have been documented.
- Added documentation for [plugin authors](https://github.com/jenkinsci/scm-api-plugin/blob/master/docs/implementation.adoc)
  who are implementing the SCM API for their SCM system and
  [consumers](https://github.com/jenkinsci/scm-api-plugin/blob/master/docs/consumer.adoc)
  of the SCM API that want to access different SCM implementations through a single generic API
- Added a [mock SCM implementation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/scm-api-plugin/tree/master/src/test/java/jenkins/scm/impl/mock) in
    the tests-jar so that consumers can write unit tests of their
    implementation without needing to create SCM servers and manipulate
    SCM repositories to generate events or test conditions.

### Version 1.3 (Sep 7, 2016)

- Infrastructure for [JENKINS-31155](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31155).
- [JENKINS-32768](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-32768) `SingleSCMSource` configuration was not properly round-tripped.
- More emphatically discourage use of `SingleSCMSource`.
